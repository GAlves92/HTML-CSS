#                                                        HTML - CSS

This project was designed to create a visualization dashboard website using visualizations from a past project using Matplotlib. 
I have created individual pages for each plot and a route which makes it possible to navigate between them all. The pages contain an explanation about the plots and their relationship with Latitude. There is also a landing page, which you can visualize all plots at once, and a page containing the data used to create the plots. 

You will be able to visualize:

•	A Landing page;

•	A Comparison page;

•	A Data page containing a table with gathered data;

•	Four pages displaying each individual plot.
